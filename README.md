# TI-Server-Checker
Checks the status of TI Official Evrima Stress Test Servers

It is a Powershell Script that will install depencies if required.

The script does not take any paramters atm. It just queries all currently known The Isle Official Evrima Stress Test servers and shows only those that currently have a slot free.
